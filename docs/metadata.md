# Metadata

A term that I've probably used a bit too much in this project.
It basically stands for any additional information about a station/channel that is not song data.

This data should also be present on [radiopy.github.io](https://radiopy.github.io)
because scrolling through playlists on the Spotify profile without categories is not very practical.

I don't want to have to commit and push the current metadata to some kind of repository.
That's why I'm using a webserver with an FTP server to upload the metadata as a file.

## TODO

- add instructions on how I set up the server
- CORS
- make sure that the data is being processed by the website
